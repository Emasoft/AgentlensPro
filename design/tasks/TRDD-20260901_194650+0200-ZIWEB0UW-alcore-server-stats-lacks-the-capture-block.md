# alcore's server-stats has no `capture` block — `server status` prints "capture: unknown"

Observed 2026-09-01 right after deploying alcore as the live server: raw body capture WORKS
(request+response JSON written to the spool seconds after boot — verified on disk), but
`agentlenspro server status` prints `capture: unknown (server predates capture reporting)`
because alcore's `/api/server-stats` JSON has no `capture` object (the TS server reported
`capture: 709 live file(s), newest 1s ago`).

Scope: port the TS server's capture stats block (live file count + newest-file age + PARKED
count/bytes, see `standalone/server.ts` grep `capture`) into `server_stats.rs`, sourcing from the
body-writers' own counters where possible rather than a directory rescan per stats call (the TS
version's scan cost is acceptable only because stats is low-frequency — measure before copying).

Also fold in the SIGBCMGL remainder if convenient: the ttl-regime resolution consulting the
statusline `prompt_cache_ttl` ground truth is a separate concern — keep it its own change.

Acceptance: `agentlenspro server status` against a live alcore prints a real capture line;
mutation check — zeroing the counter changes the line.
