# `color` is one edit away from the popular package `colors`

## ⏵ STATE — READ THIS FIRST ON RESUME (authoritative; supersedes the body) — 2026-07-29

**PROPOSED BY THE JANITOR — awaiting approval. NOT authorized to execute.**

The janitor detected this in code the **USER owns**, so it may only propose. It has NOT touched
anything and will not, until a human or the main Claude approves by running:

```
/janitor-support-open-ticket TRDD-R6BSW0VV
```

That command opens a support ticket, promotes this TRDD `proposal → planned`, and the janitor's
scheduler dispatches **janitor-security-agent** to fix it at the next free heartbeat slot.

**Finding (a dependency carries a known advisory, severity `high`):**

**DEP-003** (typosquat-watcher, severity `high`)

**What:** A declared dependency's name is within a small edit distance of a widely-used package — the signature of a typosquat.

**Why it matters:** Typosquats exist to be installed by accident and to run code at install time. The cost of checking is one lookup; the cost of missing one is a compromised machine.

**Fix to attempt:** Verify the package is the one that was intended (registry, repo, download counts). If it is a squat, remove it and audit what its install scripts did.

**Found:** npm:color vs 'colors' (distance ≤ 1) in downloads_dev/npm-publish-trusted-publishing-bun/_extracted/vidpipe-main/vidpipe-main/package-lock.json

**Evidence:**
- `downloads_dev/npm-publish-trusted-publishing-bun/_extracted/vidpipe-main/vidpipe-main/package-lock.json`

## Verification

The dispatched agent is fail-safe: it fixes what is safe and FLAGS what needs a human (it never
rotates credentials, never force-pushes, never pushes to `main`). It returns one line plus a report
path, and closes the ticket with an explicit status.

## Notes and lessons learned
