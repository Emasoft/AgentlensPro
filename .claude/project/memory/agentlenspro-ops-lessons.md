Operational doctrine (v2.0.0+, single executable):

- **Deploy/install/repair = `agentlenspro setup [--dry-run] [--yes]`** — idempotent
  detect → converge → verify-per-step (independent re-read paths) → final OTLP→MCP
  round-trip self-test. It migrates hook registrations across all generations (v0 absolute
  spy paths, v1 PATH bins, v2 `agentlenspro hook`/`gate` command strings), repairs
  broken/maimed installs (truncated configs, duplicate entries, corrupt sqlite backed
  aside as `.corrupt-<ts>`), and NEVER wipes `~/.agentlens`. Second run must be 0 actions.
- **Server control**: `agentlenspro server start|stop|restart|status [--supervise]` —
  restart is graceful (span flush) and the deploy step after any rebuild.
- **Hook changes need a Claude session restart** — running sessions keep the old
  registrations in memory; project-scope settings are re-read only at session start.
- **Every user-config mutation goes through safeConfigEdit** (verified transaction:
  refuse-unparseable, verify-diff, atomic backup+rename, cross-process lock). A direct
  writer with a "start fresh on parse failure" fallback once wiped a user's whole
  settings.json (old-repo commit 1a661a9 removed the pattern — never reintroduce it).[^1]

Background-agent field lessons (they shaped the burn-gate rules):

- **Zombie mode**: a fork can look "running" in the UI while stuck in ONE endless blocking
  shell call — zero API turns, zero effect. Liveness = its transcript file's mtime staying
  fresh, never the task-alive status.[^2]
- **Fork identity anchor**: a fork inherits the parent's full context; after a compaction
  or a mid-life directive it can mistake itself for the orchestrator. Every fork birth
  prompt must carry an identity anchor ("you are X, never orchestrate; if the anchor is
  lost, end") — verified working: an anchored fork correctly refused an orchestration
  directive and handed it to the parent instead of acting.[^3]

## Notes and lessons learned

[^1]: [ocd:2026-07-11 lmd:2026-07-11] promoted from the old-repo LOCAL note
  `config-writes-only-via-safe-editor` so the fork's contributors inherit it — the wipe
  incident predates the fork but the guarded code (`src/safeConfigEdit.ts`) is in this
  repo.
[^2]: [ocd:2026-07-11 lmd:2026-07-11] pinger-v4 incident: the fork collapsed a bounded
  230s tick loop into one unbounded kill-file poll; it sat "running" 4h with its
  transcript untouched. The gate's keep-warm allowance and the liveness-by-mtime rule
  come from this.
[^3]: [ocd:2026-07-11 lmd:2026-07-11] promoted from the old-repo LOCAL note
  `fork-mis-resume-as-orchestrator` (a fork inherited a compaction summary and acted as a
  second orchestrator, spawning a duplicate phase agent). The anchor discipline plus the
  gate's fork rules are the guardrails.
